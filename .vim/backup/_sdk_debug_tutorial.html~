            Purpose and Scope
        </h4>
        <p>
            The SDK Debug View is a way for iOS developers to verify that they have properly implemented the YMC SDK.
        </p>



        <h4>
            Workflow
        </h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Instrument your code with the YMC SDK, according to the documentation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a build of your app that is not an App Store distribution build -- e.g. run your app in the Xcode iOS Simulator
                </li>
                <li>
                    Navigate to the analytics page of your app, sign in and click on the SDK Debug View menu item
                </li>
                <li>
                    Perform actions that should generate and send analytics SDK events
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click the Reload button to fetch the most recently-sent ananlytics events
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the event description (e.g. <code>Time</code>, <code>IP Address</code>, etc) to identify events sent by your device.
                    Details of the event can be verified by clicking the button to expand the event item and display the actual event JSON.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't see your events showing up, retry from the start.
        </p>




        <h4>
            Custom Events
        </h4>
        <p>
        The SDK Debug View also supports custom events that you create, define and send yourself, such as <code>level-up</code>, or <code>gain-collectable-05</code>.
            Again, complete JSON data from these can be viewed by clicking to expand the item.
        </p>




        <h4>
            Technical Stuff
        </h4>
        <p>
            The SDK Debug View shows YMC SDK analytics events sent under any of the following conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                iOS Simulators running from Xcode
            </li>
            <li>
                Development builds uploaded from Xcode onto a device plugged into the machine running Xcode
            </li>
            <li>
                iOS Ad hoc builds
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That is, pretty much anything that's not an Apple App Store distribution build, or non-iOS. (That's right --
            the SDK Debug View only supports iOS so far).
        </p>
        <p>
            Events are sent automatically to the Debug View and will not contribute to the data that is represented by our
            charts for the major KPIs, such as <i>Active Users</i> or <i>ARPU</i>.
